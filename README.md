# AssayAnalyze by Elizabeth Bowen
A Matlab tool for computationally analyzing scratch and transwell assays

[note: any live scripts (.mlx) can only be opened/viewed in Matlab]

## ScratchAssay: quantify # of pixels in the gap
- 
- 
## cellCounter: count cells in a transwell assay
- 
- **cellCounter.mlx** is a more user-friendly version of the script (live script version) that can only be used/viewed inside of Matlab. Once opened in matlab, navigate to the "VIEW" tab at the top of the window and select the "Hide Code" option. Then fill in the empty fields according to the instructions to the right & hit the "Run" button.
- **cellCounter.m** can be viewed in github. The ... fields must be filled in by the user.
- **cellCounter_InteractiveLiveScript** is less fast/efficient. It can process one image at a time & allows the user to see the intermediate image processing steps for the cell counting operation.
