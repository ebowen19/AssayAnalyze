# AssayAnalyze by Elizabeth Bowen
A Matlab tool for computationally analyzing scratch and transwell assays
- *Scratch Assay:* Measures the number of pixels in the gap and exports that data to an excel file
##***cellCounter*** Counts the number of individual cells in a **transwell assay** photo
  - **cellCounter.mlx** is a more user-friendly version of the script (live script version) that can only be used/viewed inside of Matlab. Once opened in matlab, navigate to the "VIEW" tab at the top of the window and select the "Hide Code" option. Then fill in the empty fields according to the instructions to the right & hit the "Run" button.
  - **cellCounter.m** can be viewed in github. The ... fields must be filled in by the user.
